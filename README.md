# Parse-CC-Base-Rust

This is a parser for my personal notetaking, but I've uploaded it in case anyone else wants to take a crack at it. It 
converts your story notes into a JSON format using Rust. A sample story note organization may look like-

The way it organizes stuff is by specific indentation in a txt document, which is shown further below. Use the text base 
file provided as a guide.

# Level One

Level One indentation will have nothing but the text starting immediately. Used for naming seasons.

# Level Two

Level Two indentation will have an asterisk before the text starting. Used for naming episodes.

# Level Three

Level Three indentation will have three spaces before the asterisk and text. Used for marking characters, locations, 
start dates, timelines, and songs.

# Level Four

Level Four indentation will have six spaces before the asterisk and text. Used for listing the content of the level 
three stuff and categorizing songs.

# Level Five

Level Five indentation will have nine spaces before the asterisk and text. Used for specifying scenes where specific 
songs are used.

# Level Six

Level Six indentation will have twelve spaces before the asterisk and text. Used for specifying songs for specific 
scenes.

To run this program, first build using "cargo build", then run the script using "cargo run". This was 
written using Visual Studio Code and rustc CLI commands. You have to copy the file's path (AKA Casual Roleplay Base.txt) into the program terminal.

Running the program will return a folder called "Output" with the parsed JSON file of all your content, a list of characters, a list of 
locations, and a list of songs. It will be saved to the same folder as your input base file. The program WILL crash if it can't find what is needed.

Have fun!
